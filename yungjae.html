<div id="level-one"><p>Our son was born on January 28th, 2019 at 1:25 PM local time.
His passport will read “Samuel Yung Jae Kim”, and his parents will call him “Yung Jae”. He shares the first syllable
of his Korean given name with his maternal grandfather and the second syllable with his older brother.
Using the Korean alphabet, this is “영재” and with his mother’s family name would be “김영재” (Kim Yung Jae).
</p><p>
With Chinese characters (called “hanja” in Korean) being the predominate form of writing in 
Korea until the 1900s, some words and names can still be represented with hanja. After selecting
Yung Jae because of the sound and family associations, we chose to use the same hanja “榮在” used 
for his grandfather's and brother's names. (Adding his mother’s family name, this would be “金榮在”). 
In both modern Korean and Chinese, these characters have similar meanings and usages: 榮 can mean “flourishing” or
“honor”, and 在 has the connotation of “at” or “in” or “to be”.
