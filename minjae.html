<div id="level-one"><h1>Joseph Min Jae Dins</h1></div>

<div id="level-one"><p>Our third son was born on February 12th, 2021 at 12:20 PM local time.
His birth certificate will read “Joseph Min Jae Dins”, and his parents will call him “Min Jae”.
Given that we have an old testament name (Samuel), we liked the new testament name Joseph. His Korean
given name also has a family association in that all three of our boys use the character “Jae” in their names.
Using the Korean alphabet, this is “민재” and in a Korean context requiring a full name, he may use
his mother’s family name — “김민재” (Kim Min Jae).
</p><p>
With Chinese characters (called “hanja” in Korean) being the predominate form of writing in 
Korea until the 1900s, some words and names can still be represented with hanja. 
After selecting Min Jae because of the sound and family association, we selected hanja “旼在” to add a level of meaning. (Adding his
mother’s family name, this would be “金旼在”).
In both Korean and Chinese, these characters have similar meanings and usages: 旼 can mean “gentle” or
“affable” in the sense of being a gentleman (君子), and 在 has the connotation of “at” or “in” or “to be”.
