<div id="level-one"><p>Our son was born on February 10th, 2017 at 3:55 PM local time.
His passport will read “Carl Jae Kyung Dins”, and his parents will call him “Jae Kyung”. He is the sixth
Carl Dins and the first to be born outside the USA since Carl F. W. Dins (born in 1834) emigrated from Prussia.
Using the Korean alphabet, this is “재경” and in a Korean context requiring a full name, he may use
his mother’s family name — “김재경” (Kim Jae Kyung).
</p><p>
With Chinese characters (called “hanja” in Korean) being the predominate form of writing in 
Korea until the 1900s, some words and names can still be represented with hanja. After selecting
Jae Kyung because we liked the sound, we selected hanja “在經” to add a level of meaning. (Adding his
mother’s family name, this would be “金在經”). In both modern Korean and Chinese, these characters have
similar meanings and usages: 在 is a preposition “at” or “in”, and 經 is used in the words “scripture” and “Bible”.
在 and 經 are used in other words and contexts, so a Korean or Chinese speaker would not immediately associate
“in the Word” upon seeing 在經, but it would be clear with a little explanation of his parents’ intention.
